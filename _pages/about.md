Welcome to my website! My name is Ziyao Wang. I am currently a PhD candidate student supervised by [Prof. Tao Yu](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/ep/2017/1222/c5301a241017/page.htm) in smart distribution network planning group at [college of electric power, South China University of Technology](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ep/), China. I will do my research under the supervision of [Associate Prof. Jimmy Peng]( https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/jimmy-chih-hsien-peng/) in [PEng Lab](https://www.penglaboratory.com) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) from Sept 2024 to Sept 2025.

I have a strong research interest in Explicit Model-based Reliability Assessment, Digital Planning of Distribution Networks, Integration of Operations Research and Machine Learning/AI in Distribution Network.

As the student leader of the smart distribution network planning group in the lab, I take responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the progress of various technology projects, organizing regular academic communication and group meetings. Besides, as main R&D personnel, I participated in a series of distribution network planning projects for China Southern Power Grid and State Grid Corporation of China, and developed a digital distribution network planning software system, actively promoted its application.
